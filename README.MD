This program is an entry for my high school programming competition.  The goal, as far as I could understand is to create a program that can track income/expenses, and give average spending/receiving for the past week.

The total amount of time I have worked on it is 4 hours and 30 minutes.  And I would say it turned out to be pretty good for so little time.

The executable Jar file `Income.jar` can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ttocsneb/Income-TCC/raw/master/Income.jar)
